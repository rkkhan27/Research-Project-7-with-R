## Repeated Sampling and Water Conservation (2022-11-02)

In this homework we will use R to simulate selecting a random sample from a population, repeatedly. We
will do this under the unusual circumstance where we have data for the whole population. This means we
can compare what we learn in each sample (estimates) to what we wanted to know about the population
(population parameters) in the unusal situation where we know the population paramater values.
In 2007, a water utility in Atlanta implemented a natural field experiment using all of their water customers,
which was just under 140,000 households The data we use for this HW gives the water use for that whole
population. Although not our main focus for this assignment, the water utility randomized their customers
(as households) into four treatment arms: a control group, a group that received technical advice, a group
that received both technical advice and an appeal to pro-social preferences, and a group that received both
technical advice and an appeal to pro-social preferences that included a social comparison (see Ferraro and
Price 2009).
